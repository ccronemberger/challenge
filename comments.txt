Things missing:

- authentication, authorization, so only the owner of an account can request to transfer funds from it
- Open API (Swagger)
- Locking was implemented using synchronized blocks and this will not work in a cluster. Could use optimistic lock instead.
- Ideally the AccountsControllerTest should use the annotation @WebMvcTest with the controller being tested,
  so not all controllers and not all beans of the application are started because we want to test only the AccountsController.
  This way MockMvc can be autowired instead of being created manually.
- monitoring facilities
- transaction management
- validation of initial balance should not happen only at controller level
- I don't think we should have a getter for the attribute accountsRepository in the class AccountsService, it is used
  only in tests and we can get this reference via dependency injection instead
- get account is now returning BAD_REQUEST in case of invalid account id instead of empty response
